# TextExtraction

This project focuses on text extraction from images using the Tesseract OCR engine, OpenCV, and Gradio. The goal of the project is to develop an AI-powered application that can analyze images and extract text present within them.

The application begins by utilizing OpenCV to load and process the input image. The image is converted to grayscale, which helps enhance the text recognition process.


Using the pytesseract library, the project leverages the power of the Tesseract OCR engine to perform text extraction on the grayscale image. By applying advanced optical character recognition techniques, the application scans the image and converts the text content into a machine-readable format. The extracted text is then checked for its presence. If no text is found in the image, a prompt message is displayed to indicate the absence of text.


The Gradio library is employed to create a user-friendly interface for the application. The interface allows users to upload an image and initiate the text extraction process. The extracted text is displayed as the output, providing users with the recognized text from the image. The interface also includes a description to guide users on how to utilize the application effectively.


This text extraction project has broad applications across various domains. It can be utilized in digitizing printed documents, extracting information from images for data analysis, or automating data entry tasks. By leveraging OCR techniques, the application enables users to extract and process textual information from images, opening up possibilities for automated text analysis and further downstream processing.


Overall, this project showcases the integration of Tesseract OCR, OpenCV, and Gradio to build a text extraction application. It offers a convenient and efficient solution for extracting text from images, contributing to improved automation and analysis of textual content.
